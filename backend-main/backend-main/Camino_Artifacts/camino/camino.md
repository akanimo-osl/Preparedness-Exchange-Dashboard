# Camino — The Sacred Path of Systems

## 🛤️ Purpose
This repository holds the artifacts of a cloud-native, AI-integrated, real-time data orchestration system.

## 📦 Components
- Frontend cache with IndexedDB
- Realtime map dashboard
- Redis cache invalidation layer
- Azure ML analytics pipeline

- Frontend data sync via context & sockets

## 🔥 Flame Laws
1. Process only once.
2. No raw data lives outside Azure.
3. Frontend is stateless, always replaceable.
4. All logic is modular.
5. Real-time is sacred. Delay is betrayal.
