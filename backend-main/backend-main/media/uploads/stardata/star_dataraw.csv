• Informal populations 
• Farm workers and farmers 

Environmental factors:
• Rapid, unplanned urbanisation (informal settlements)
• Fragile & dangerous physical environments (poor housing conditions)
• Lack of critical infrastructure (water, sanitation, electricity, etc.)
• Poor environmental & resource management
• Increased environment & resource degradation & overconsumption (natural resource crises)
•Increased extreme weather events resulting in higher frequency & severity of hazards
•Human environmental damage: pollution, poor sanitation & waste management

Governance & Leadership:
• Compromised systems of good governance & organisational systems
•Poor performance of lower-level government structures

Technological:
• Insufficient information dissemination
• Insufficient information & data on hazards & vulnerabilities

Economic:
•Poor economic growth & debt crisis
•Unemployment and low-income levels
•Fragile local economies
•Lack of skills & resources

",Very high,"Governance:
• Existing governance structures and communication strategies are in place to activate resources needed e.g. through NDMC, NATJOINTS, IMC, DJOC, ProvJOC
• Contingency Plans, e.g. business continuity plans for drought
• Debriefing and lessons learnt is a weakness
• Triaging system supports the access to care at a faster rate

Health Sector: 
• There are sufficient health governance coping capacities at national, provincial and local levels
• There is sufficient health infrastructure and systems to respond 
• Rapid response teams 
• Simulation exercises
• Emergency Medical Services capacity 
• Casualty capacity (incl. sufficient HCWs) 
• Primary healthcare capacity – water-borne diseases & injuries 
• Mortuary capacities
• Hospital capacity – ICU, paediatric wards 
• Forensic pathology services 
• Partnerships with the private sector 

Non-health Sector: 
• All government sectors come together to respond to a health emergency including water, agriculture, education, communication etc. There is thus capacity in the non-health sector
• Multi sectoral teams 

Community capacities 
• Civil organisations, and religious organisations have capacity to support communities to health emergencies
• NPO and NGOs (e.g. gift of the givers) support 
• Presence and active engagement of NGOs e.g. churches, civil rights groups etc. 

Resources
• There are financial resources to respond to health emergencies
•There are human resources present that can support the response to  health emergencies 
• availability of PPE 
• Logistics, 
• Disaster relief funds
• Transportation 
• IT health infrastructure
• Early warning systems for floods
• EMS Ambulances
• Helicopters through multisectoral collaborations 
• Partnering with private companies to gain access to air vehicles to support the response
• Financing – when a disaster is declared, resources are made available

For many patients, lesions disappear after 10-12 weeks; however, for those with lesions occurring in the macula, approximately 50% of patients will have permanent vision loss.
2. Encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, can lead to headaches, coma, or seizures. This occurs in less than 1% of patients and presents 1-4 weeks after the first symptoms appear. Though death from this is rare, neurological deficits, sometimes severe, may persist.
3. Hemorrhagic fever, occurs in less than 1% of overall RVF patients, but fatality for those who do develop these symptoms, is around 50%.
